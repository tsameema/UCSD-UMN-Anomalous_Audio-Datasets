# Audio Datasets Repository

"This repository hosts a collection of audio datasets capturing diverse scenes, including UCSD PED 2, UMN_LAWN, and UMN_INTERIOR. These datasets serve various purposes, such as enabling audio analysis, supporting machine learning applications, and facilitating computer vision research. It's worth noting that video data for the mentioned scenes is already available, and we have painstakingly synchronized the acoustic data with these video files.

For the video data of UCSD PED 2, you can find it [here](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/anomaly/dataset.htm).

To access the video data for the UMN dataset, please follow this [link](http://mha.cs.umn.edu/movies/crowdactivity-all.avi)."
